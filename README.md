# Candy Crush Cracker

A Chrome extension to automatically complete levels for you, and to give you unlimitied lives, while playing Candy Crush on Facebook (https://apps.facebook.com/candycrush/). See it in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdEoZXQPxNE

The extension has been removed from the Chrome Extension store, so it can only be installed from its source currently. See below for installation instructions.

The JavaScript file used to integrate into the Candy Crush API (CandyCrush.js) was generated automatically using Gargl (http://jodoglevy.com/jobloglevy/?p=5) (https://github.com/jodoglevy/gargl), without writing a line of code. This weekend project serves as an example of what can be done with Gargl.
