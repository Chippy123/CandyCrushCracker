# CandyCrushCracker

A Chrome extension to automatically complete levels for you, and to give you unlimitied lives, while playing Candy Crush on Facebook (https://apps.facebook.com/candycrush/).

The JavaScript file used to integrate into the Candy Crush API (CandyCrush.js) was generated automatically using Gargl (http://jodoglevy.com/jobloglevy/?p=5) (https://github.com/jodoglevy/gargl), without writing a line of code. This weekend project serves as an example of what can be done with Gargl.
