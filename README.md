The JavaScript file used to integrate into the Candy Crush API (CandyCrush.js) was generated automatically using Gargl (http://jodoglevy.com/jobloglevy/?p=5) (https://github.com/jodoglevy/gargl), without writing a line of code. This weekend project serves as an example of what can be done with Gargl.
